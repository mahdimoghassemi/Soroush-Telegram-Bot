In this project, I have developed an Othello game play using the C programming language. Othello, also known as Reversi, is a classic board game where two players compete to have the majority of their colored discs on the board at the end of the game.

The objective of my project was to create a code that could play against a tester and ultimately win the game. To achieve this, I implemented various algorithms and strategies to make intelligent moves and outmaneuver the opponent.

The code I wrote for this project utilizes a combination of techniques. These techniques allow the program to evaluate different possible moves and choose the one that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's opportunities.

Throughout the development process, I focused on optimizing the code for efficiency and speed. This involved carefully designing data structures to represent the game board and implementing efficient algorithms for move generation and evaluation.

To test my program's capabilities, I played multiple games against a tester who made random moves. The goal was to demonstrate that my code could consistently make strategic decisions that would lead to victory.

Overall, this project showcases my proficiency in C programming and my ability to develop complex algorithms for game playing. By successfully creating a code that can play Othello against a tester and win consistently, I have demonstrated my understanding of artificial intelligence concepts and problem-solving skills in programming.
